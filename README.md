# Disclaimer: Javier Rosas had some issues with Git and Heroku, so he had to re-clone the repository on August 5. As a result, Javier Rosas's commits do not appear on Github analytics, but he did contribute to the project meaningfully.

## Most code was written by the both of us or taken from the Movie Mern project we coded throughout the course.
